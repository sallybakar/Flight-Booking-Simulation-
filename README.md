  ## Summary
  Flight-Booking-Simulation refers to the imitation or replication of the flight booking process in a virtual environment. This simulation typically involves creating a software or system that mimics the steps and interactions users go through when booking a flight. It allows developers, testers, or users to experience and assess the functionality of the flight booking system without making actual reservations. The simulation may include various elements such as selecting destinations, dates, seats, and payment processes to ensure the smooth operation of the flight booking system in a controlled and risk-free setting.
